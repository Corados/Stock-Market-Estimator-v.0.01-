# Stock-Market-Estimator-v.0.01-
A Java-based application that analyzes and estimates stock market trends using financial APIs and mathematical models.

## Introduction
Recently, many individual investors have entered the stock market. However, many lack a deep understanding of market dynamics, often buying stocks simply based on brand recognition and panic-selling at the slightest dip, leading to regrettable losses.

I believe this happens due to a lack of accessible analysis tools. While every investor has their own strategy, technical analysis provides a data-driven perspective on market trends.

This project aims to bridge that gap by developing a program that simplifies complex technical indicators. Our goal is to provide a reliable reference for financial beginners, helping them understand potential market movements and make more informed investment decisions.


## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java 17
* **API:** Finnhub Stock API (Real-time & Historical data)
* **Libraries:** - `java.net.http.HttpClient` (Standard Java HTTP client)
  - `Jackson` (For JSON deserialization)

## Must Thing To Ensure
- This program is a program to predict in a simple equation do not try to push customer to buy the stock.

## RoadMap
- [ ] v.01 Make a website to sketchy the program that we will make it
- [ ] v.02 Based on CLI Analyze the data draw a slope of the previous stock market
- [ ] v.03 Database(SQL/H2) connect
- [ ] v.03 GUI Library(JavaFx)
- [ ] v.04 RealTime Notification(Websocket) system

 ## How we will analyze the Data
 - Based on Calculus calculate the changing and predict the future of the stock market.
